                        <p><strong>Burnaby, British Columbia</strong><br><em>June 2015 - Aug 2016</em></p>
                        <p id="SE">
                            Schneider Electric is my second Co-op experience from SFU! I was originally hired for 10 months (2 semesters), but I got the opportunity to extend for another term which ended up being a 14-month Co-op term! Having learned about telecommunication technology during my time at BlackBerry, I felt that joining a company like Schneider Electric would provide me with a great learning experience in different areas of electrical engineering, specifically solar technology and power electronics.<br><br>At Schneider Electric, I was part of the Solar Off-grid Department in the <em>Software Test Team</em>, and my job title was <strong>Software Test Engineer</strong>. My main responsibilites included: development and maintenance of automated Python test scripts; excuting manual and automated software tests; setup and maintain automation test platform; analyze and document test results; and verify software bugs and fixes. The main product I was working with were the <a href="http://solar.schneider-electric.com/product/conext-xw-na-solar-inverter/" id="xw"><strong>XW+/CSW Inverter-Chargers</strong></a>. The inverter-charger is one of the main components in a solar plant setup, it is responsible for inverting harvested DC power into AC power (DC to AC), as well as having the functionality to charge from the grid (AC to DC). I also spent time performing firmware testing for the <a href="http://solar.schneider-electric.com/product/conext-combox/" id="xw"><strong>Conext ComBox</strong></a>, a monitoring and control device that oversees all units in the solar setup through <em>Xanbus</em>, an internal network protocol. Some of the other products I have worked with include: charge controllers (High/Low Volt MPPT), control devices (SCP, AGS), and monitoring tools (Insight, Battery monitor).<br><br>During my extension term (last four months of Co-op), I was assigned to mentor the new Co-op of his daily tasks and teach him about the company's technology. In addition, I was tasked to develop new automation scripts for the <a href="https://www.typhoon-hil.com/products/hil602" id="xw"><strong>Typhoon HIL602</strong></a>. Typhoon HIL is a powerful hardware that can easily simulate large power electronics systems. With a built in circuit compiler (Schematic Editor) and the HIL Control Center, I am able to easily modify and test different models of Schneider Electric products.<br><br>Two achievements I am most proud of during my time at Schneider Electric are the improvements I made to the automation testing and the test documentations. With the new automation scripts I created, I was able to reduce the amount of manual testing and execution time of our regression tests. I also performed enhancements to existing scripts to increase  test coverage, which also results in less manual testing. For the test documentation, I authored a detailed test report for one of the XW+ test configurations. This report will be useful for testers to use in the future as a reference or guideline.</p>

                        <p><strong>Ottawa, Ontario</strong><br><em>Sept 2012 - May 2013</em></p>
                        <p id="BBID">BlackBerry (formerly known as RIM) was my very first Co-op experience from university! I was extremely thrilled when I got the job offer, I knew that this would be a valuable opportunity to learn new skills, gain industry experience and also expand my network. To seize this opportunity, I had to move out away from my family for the first time in my life. For the next 8 months, I learned to live on my own and become more confident and independent.<br><br>At BlackBerry, I was in the <em>System Integration and IOT team</em>, and my job title was <strong>Wireless Interoperability Protocol Associate</strong>. My tasks and responsibilities include: wireless protocol conformance testing and certification of the latest pre-release BlackBerry mobile handsets; run test cases directly from different carrier providers; and review software designs using both automated and manual tests. To perform these tests, I had to work in a chamber that blocks off outside network signals, and inside the chamber are where the cellular lab equipments <em>Agilent</em> and <em>Spirent</em> are located. These network emulators allowed me to simulate accurate and precise network signals so that I can perform the test plans from different carriers including Verizon Wireless. I was fortunate to have worked at BlackBerry during this time period as I joined just as <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_10" id="BBRY">BlackBerry 10</a></strong> was about to be released. I learned a lot about how a large company operates before the launch of a new product, especially time management and prioritization of tasks. </p>

                            <p id="capstone">Engineering Capstone Project (S.F.U.)</p>
                            <p id="capstone2"><strong>CART-FOLLOW-X1</strong><br>For my engineering capstone project, I worked with four other senior engineering students to build and design an automated cart. Our motivation for this project is to improve convenience for cargo carrying and that it can eventually be used in many different applications.
<br><br>The cart has two main functionalities: Follow-mode and Assist-mode. Assist-mode is when the user presses the "Assist" button on the handle of the cart, the cart will then be motorized allowing the user to easily move the cart with the assistance of the motor. Follow-mode is the main feature of this cart. The user simply needs to switch the operation mode (from the cart handle) and the cart will start following the user, allowing the user to operate the cart "hands-free". The follow mechanism is implemented using ultrasonic sensors on the cart. The sensors serve as the tracking mechanism as well as collision detection. The "brain" of the cart is the control system, it was implemented with three Raspberry Pi B+ units and a DC Motor Driver.
<br><br>Our team was split into two groups, three of us (myself included) would be responsible for the Control System design, while the other two would be responsible for the Mechanical design. The control system was designed using Python, and the main functionalities include: user-tracking (distance calculation and turning distance calculation), collsion detection (collision distance calculation), motor control (motor speed calculation), and user interface buttons (on/off switch, mode switch, and LEDs).<br><br>In the end, we were able to complete a prototype and demo the product to our professors and instructors. I was really proud of the end result, as we used everything we learned in engineering from our first year to our last to complete this project. This project had a mix of electronics, mechanical design, and coding. In the end, the project was a success as we managed to achieve an excellent grade on the project. I've also included a short video clip of our prototype in action! In addition to the project, we were required to write up formal documentations. The documents can be accessed from the links below:

                            <p id="realtime2"><strong>UART Performance Monitor</strong><br>For my Real Time &amp; Embedded Systems course, I worked in a team of three to design a VGA and UART driver to create a graphical performance monitor that will run on an embedded system (PetaLinux) using a FPGA board (Zedboard). The graphical console is capable of printing typed text, while also collecting and displaying live metrics about the system.<br><br>My task for this project was to develop a timer driver and timer interrupt service routine to implement a timer to collect basic statistics from the operation of the UART. I was also responsible for implementing a VGA driver to allocate the frame buffer in kernel-space and allow access to the frame buffer from user-space. The metrics and statistics that I implemented include: Time since boot up; character received; average read/write time per character; total time reading/writing characters; number of characters sent/received since startup; and total consol time. In the timer driver design, I implemented both hardware and software timers as our design measured timing for receiving and sending characters.<br><br>My group members were responsible for designing the framework for graphics support, and designing a VGA typing console. In the end, we combined our sections for the final product. Our design utilizes screen space by dividing it into two equal sections horizontally, the top supporting the typing console, and the bottom used for displaying the system metrics. This layout allows for text to be readable and avoids excessive wrapping. As seen in the picture below, the top section allows user to type up to 360 characters before the screen clears, and the bottom displays live statistical information.</p>

So I decided to use this extra time to take an online course and learn web development. Through this course I learned the basics of HTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap and PHP. I decided to use this new knowledge to create my own personal website. The design of this website is a simple top-down website with a fixed navigation bar at the top. With mobile devices becoming more and more popular, the site is also made to be compatible on mobile devices! On this site I will update my recent work experience, projects and other interests!</p>

                                       <p>Steam is an Internet-based digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation offering digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer gaming and social networking services. I like to browse Steam's catalogue of content because of the frequent deals they have. Some of the other games I frequently play are also found in Steam.
